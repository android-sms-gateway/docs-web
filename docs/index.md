Android SMS Gateway turns your Android smartphone into an SMS gateway. It's a lightweight application that allows you to send SMS messages programmatically via an API and receive webhooks on incoming SMS. This makes it ideal for integrating SMS functionality into your own applications or services.

## Features

- **No registration required:** No registration or email is required to create an account. In local mode, you don't need an account at all!
- **Send SMS via API:** Use our API to send messages directly from your applications or services.
- **Support for Android 5.0 and above:** The application is compatible with Android 5.0 and later versions.
- **Message status tracking:** Monitor the status of sent messages in real-time.
- **Automatic startup:** The application starts running as soon as your device boots up.
- **Support for multiple SIM cards:** The application supports devices with multiple SIM cards.
- **Multipart messages:** The application supports sending long messages with auto-partitioning.
- **End-to-end encryption:** The application provides end-to-end encryption by encrypting message content and recipients' phone numbers before sending them to the API and decrypting them on the device.
- **Message expiration:** The application allows setting an expiration time for messages. Messages will not be sent if they have expired.
- **Random delay between messages:** Introduces a random delay between sending messages to avoid mobile operator restrictions.
