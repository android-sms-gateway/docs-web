## "Does not have `android.permission.SEND_SMS`" Error üõ°Ô∏è

The app requires the `android.permission.SEND_SMS` permission to send SMS messages. While the app requests this permission on first launch, if for any reason it wasn't granted you may need to grant it manually.

!!! tip "Manual Permission Setup" 
    1. :gear: Open device Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí SMS Gateway  
    2. :material-shield-key: Navigate to Permissions ‚Üí SMS  
    3. :material-toggle-switch: Enable SMS permission  
    
!!! tip "Hidden Permissions"
    On some devices:

    - Tap ‚ãÆ menu ‚Üí "All permissions"  
    - Locate SMS under "Not allowed" section  
    - Change to "Allow"

## `RESULT_ERROR_GENERIC_FAILURE` Error ‚ö†Ô∏è

The `RESULT_ERROR_GENERIC_FAILURE` error can occur for various reasons:

- :money_with_wings: **Low Balance**: Check SIM balance
- :material-signal-off: **Network Issues**: Verify signal bars, try airplane mode toggle  
- :material-sim-off: **SIM Problems**:
    - Reinsert SIM card.
    - Test in different device.
    - Contact carrier for activation status.

## `RESULT_ERROR_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` Error üö´

The `RESULT_ERROR_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` error occurs when:

1. Reaching Android‚Äôs internal SMS queue limit
2. Exceeding carrier-imposed sending limits
3. Triggering anti-spam protections

This error indicates the system has blocked further messages to prevent abuse. Key considerations:

- **Android Queue Limit**: The OS restricts sending to many messages in a short period. The limits can be adjusted via ADB, see [this guide](https://www.xda-developers.com/change-sms-limit-android/)
- **Carrier Limits**: Most carriers allow 30-200 SMS/hour. Exceeding may cause temporary blocks. Always consult your carrier's policy.
- **SIM Risks**: High-volume sending may lead to carrier penalties or SIM blocking. Always check your carrier's Terms of Service (ToS).

3. Choose preferred SIM for sending in the default messaging app

!!! tip "API Workaround"
    To send SMS using a specific SIM card, provide the SIM card slot number in the `simNumber` field of your request.

    ```json title="Explicit SIM Specification" hl_lines="4"
    {
        "message": "Test",
        "phoneNumbers": ["+1234567890"],
        "simNumber": 1
    }
    ```

## `Can't send message: No SIMs found` Error üì¥

This error occurs when the app cannot detect any SIM cards on the device. There are several possible causes for this issue:

=== "Hardware Issues"  
 
    - :material-sim-alert: SIM not fully inserted  
    - :material-chip: SIM card has poor contact  
    - :material-wrench: Damaged SIM tray

    1. :material-shield-refresh: For Xiaomi devices:
        - Enable Developer Options (tap Build Number 7x)
        - Disable MIUI optimizations to prevent the app from requesting permissions repeatedly
        - Reboot device
 
    2. :material-key-chain: Ensure the app has all required permissions in your device settings or via ADB.  
        ```bash
        adb shell pm list permissions | grep READ_PHONE_STATE
        ```

!!! tip "Debugging"
    If the problem persists, try using the SIM card in another device to rule out hardware issues.
