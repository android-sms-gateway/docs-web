The Android SMS Gateway is open-source software and is free to use. We offer three server options for sending messages:

- **Local Server**: This option allows you to send messages for free, without any restrictions or limitations.

- **Cloud Server**: Our cloud server provides message sending capabilities that may be subject to certain limitations. If you intend to send more than 1000 messages daily via the cloud server, please contact us for detailed information and potential arrangements.

- **Private Server**: Using a self-hosted private server gives you the ability to send an unlimited number of messages. However, since push notifications are sent through our cloud server, there is a rate limit on our side. You may need to adjust the notification debounce period in your private server's configuration to accommodate this.

## Future Guarantees

- All current features will remain free for existing users indefinitely.
- We might introduce a payment system for new users of the Cloud Server in the future. This will not affect users who have already been using the app.
- New features may be introduced with an associated cost from their initial release.
